# Violet
Violet is a simple game engine. It is written with the goal of being concise and understandable, without sacrificing performance. I am also using it as a platform to experiment with new algorithms.

### Features
* OpenGL 3.3 rendering
* Simple, flexible UI system
* Basic scene editor with instant saving
* SQLite scene file format
* Basic collision (OBB/AABB)
* Rigid body physics (in progress)
* Lua scripting (in progress)
